# SQL Projects From Completed Learning Programs
Khan Academy Store Analysis
	As part of going through Khan Academy's Intro to SQL course, the learner is
	asked to create a store inventory of at least 15 items with relevant data that
	would cover 5 different columns.
	For my fitional store I used data from a data set called "Market Basket Analysis 
	created and uploaded by Aslan Ahmedov on Kaggle.
	From the dataset I used the top 15 items, item name, and associated price.

	In SQL I oraganized the data into descriptive tables show-casing the product,
	SQL assigned identification number, amount purchased, price per unit, and which
	aisle the product can be found on. Using SQL I found the total price of the quantity
	that was purchased, and how much from each asile was purchased.
